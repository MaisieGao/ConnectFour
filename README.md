This is a program that is designed to make a connect four game in which two players play the game in turn and the first player who get four pieces connected in a line(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) would win the game. We get the winner (or None if nobody won) and print out the graph when the game is finished or when the player quitted.

According the rule of connect four, I formalized the operations as methods such as add a piece, undo a move, whether the game is over, who win the game, and describe the current game state on the board in a string in the file.

I used Junit tests to test the game works as expected.
